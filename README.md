# Realsense-D435
Code which uses the Intel Realsense D435 camera for object detection along with estimation of distance of object.

Camera not with me currently, stay tuned for updates with output images.
Getting a FPS of around 11 on my i5 6th gen laptop (sadly, it runs off of the CPU only)

# Usage
```sh
./dnn
```
# Output
Will upload snapshots of the output video feed as soon as I can get my hands on the camera again. Sorry!
